        <p>I’m here to inspire you to discover your own keys on how to make you happy always or at least make the difficult times a little less dark. This blog will force you to look at what you have in life. I know you will always want to have more. But if you look at what you don’t have, you will also never have enough... Remember, the grass is always greener where you water it. So let us focus on the grass that you have and let us watch it flourish.</p>
